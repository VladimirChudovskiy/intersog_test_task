# Intersog Test Task

This repository contains a Laravel application with Docker setup for easy development.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (usually pre-installed on most Unix-based systems)

## Project Setup

### Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:VladimirChudovskiy/intersog_test_task.git
   cd intersog_test_task
   ```

2. Start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   make up
   ```

3. Install PHP dependencies:

5. (Optional) Seed the database with sample data:
   ```bash

   ```

### Environment Configuration

The project uses Docker environment variables defined in:
- `docker-compose.yml` - For Docker services configuration
- `src/.env` - For Laravel application configuration

The default database configuration is:
- Host: `db` (MySQL container)

Please change these values in `src/.env` for security and production use.
